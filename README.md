# whatIsAngularMaterial

For developers using AngularJS, Angular Material is both a UI Component framework and a reference implementation of Google's Material Design Specification.

6 Key factors of Angular-Material

1) Maintained by an official Google team (like Polymer) - Nothing gives you the confidence that there will be tons of commits & press as having Google back a project.

2) Importance of accessibility (a11y) - Keyboard control, full ngAria support and bold color contrast for the color blind and just a few of the obvious importance of a11y in ngMaterial.

3) Killer Flexbox layout - Bye-bye CSS grid. ngMaterial’s flexbox layout system simplifies the daunting CSS properties and delivers the holy grail of layouts.

4) Focus on mobile interaction - Gestures like sidenav swipe and bottom sheet pull-to-close enhance mobile UX. Having the Ionic Framework team involved definitely helped on this front.

5) Intriguing JavaScript theming decision - It took while to get use to using Angular config variables for your Material Design theme, but the ability to have multiple themes without custom CSS classes and dynamic themes open doors to new approaches.

6) SVG Iconset support - It’s super cool & convenient to be able to use a single SVG file including an entire set of SVG icons with mdIcon. Filesize concerns are quelled with template cache.
